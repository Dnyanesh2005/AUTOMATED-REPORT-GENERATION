*DESCRIPTION*:


In this Automated Report Generation task, I developed the skills to transform raw data into a structured report with minimal manual work. I started by uploading a CSV file into Google Colab and using **Pandas** to read the data, explore its contents, and calculate important metrics like averages and standard deviations. To present the findings visually, I created a labeled bar chart of the revenue data for all 20 entries using **Matplotlib**. I then combined the statistical summary and the visualization into a single PDF file using **FPDF**, producing a clear and organized report. This project was completed entirely in the Google Colab environment with Python libraries such as **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **fpdf**.
